# CutecumberðŸ¥’
 
By Yaseen, Nicky, Andy

Our software Cucumber, will be utilising AI in order to recognise foods when provided with an image.
Right now, we're working on a prototype that will be able to recognise and tell the user certain foods limited to a small amount (due to time constraints). ðŸ¥’

Check the folder "Planning" to see our Gantt Chart and progress.
Check the folder "pain peko" for the py file that contains the code
Due to time restrictions, the nutritional information display is a separate program, it is in the file "that code.py"
